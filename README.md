# Mac Setup

My OSX setup and dotfiles.

## About this project

This is still very much WIP, as such not doing much documentation now.

Once completed this will be a central place for all my dotfiles and installation
configs (for fresh mac installs).
 
It uses the excellent `brew` and `mas` libraries.
